### Bug fix

**You own this task. Plan, review, verify.** Delegate investigation and the fix to subagents, stay in the lead. Pick each subagent's reasoning level and fast or standard speed for the job, per the Subagents section.

Be scientific. Every shipped line traces to runtime evidence. Belt-and-suspenders that "might help" is a hypothesis, not a fix. It does not ship. When evidence refutes a hypothesis, revert what it motivated. The smallest change the evidence justifies ships, nothing more.

1. Reproduce it only when the code does not show the defect. Use the cheapest surface that triggers it, such as a local dev server on a Neon branch plus a few crafted requests, or the UI action via the control skill (Non-negotiables). Don't ask the user to reproduce it. If it won't reproduce directly, synthesize the trigger, tighten conditions, or instrument until it fires. When the defect is visible in the code (a missing check, a wrong condition), skip this step and let step 4 prove the fix.
2. Find the cause. When the code shows it, state it with file and line and go to step 3. When it is unknown, binary-search: form the candidate hypotheses, then rule them out until one survives. Seed them with `how` over the affected subsystem and the **why** skill for regression history. Each pass, take the split that cuts the most remaining problem space, get runtime evidence, eliminate. When program state is unclear, add instrumentation or logging and read it as the code runs. Don't guess. Drive a long or stubborn hunt with Cursor's `/loop` command. Confirm the surviving *mechanism* with runtime evidence before the step-3 architect/interrogate fan-out.
3. Plan the fix. If it crosses a function boundary, `architect` first. Delegate implementation to a subagent using your configured bug-fix model (default `grok-4.7-xhigh-fast`) with a specific scope.
4. Verify on the same surface. The original repro now passes. If step 1 was skipped, exercise the fix on the cheapest surface that reaches it. "Inconclusive" or wrong-surface is not a pass. Flag it. Unit tests show branch behavior, not bug absence.
5. Stage the commits so the failing repro lands before the fix in git history. See the **tdd** skill for the failing-test-first cadence when the bug has a cheap local test path. Skip it when the test would be expensive, integration-heavy, or unclear.
   This is the canonical **sequence-verifiable-units** principle skill, the failing test first and the fix on top.
6. Run **Opening a PR**.

**Reply:** what was broken, root cause, fix, how you verified. Paste failing-then-passing repro output verbatim.
